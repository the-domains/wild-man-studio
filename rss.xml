            <title><![CDATA[What I'm Reading]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What I'm Reading</h1><p>I bought myself a couple of artist books for my birthday. One is on George Inness (May 1, 1825 – August 3, 1894) and the other on Charles Burchfield (April 9, 1893 – January 10, 1967). I picked them because they both were influenced by their spirituality and painted, quite differently from each other, how they experienced/saw the divine in nature. They also both felt that art making was part of their religious experience. George Inness was interested in the metaphysical and was a Swedenborgian, his painting were influenced by sacred geometry and the metaphysical understanding of colors.  </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dc9f3422742f7783c8cb015acd9bf7d0a6d8a2dd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[First Snow]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>First Snow</h1><p>I started a new sketch book for watercolor sketching, my goal is to do several a week. We had our first snow here in Columbus. I love how it looked in the garden sticking to dried up plants. Behind the fence there are several buildings that all appeared grey. I blocked them in and just provided a few hard edges and peaks for indication so the focus would remain in the garden.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9935f6ca-12da-48da-bd8d-e6fabd0d1838.jpg"></article>]]></description>
