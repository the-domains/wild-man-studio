I started a new sketch book for watercolor sketching, my goal is to do several a week. We had our first snow here in Columbus. I love how it looked in the garden sticking to dried up plants. Behind the fence there are several buildings that all appeared grey. I blocked them in and just provided a few hard edges and peaks for indication so the focus would remain in the garden.
