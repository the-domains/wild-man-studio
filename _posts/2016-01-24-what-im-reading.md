I bought myself a couple of artist books for my birthday. One is on George Inness (May 1, 1825 -- August 3, 1894) and the other on Charles Burchfield (April 9, 1893 -- January 10, 1967). I picked them because they both were influenced by their spirituality and painted, quite differently from each other, how they experienced/saw the divine in nature. They also both felt that art making was part of their religious experience. George Inness was interested in the metaphysical and was a Swedenborgian, his painting were influenced by sacred geometry and the metaphysical understanding of colors.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3ada52e5-801e-4718-8ea8-e8c32600a964.jpg)

_Landscape II_ by George Inness   

Charles Burchfield wanted to paint nature how our ancestors may have viewed it filled with spirits and forces. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b608e6a9-adfb-4cfa-9b36-9a4860ce4ff9.jpg)

_Summer Solstice_ by Charles Burchfield 

The books talk about these aspects especially their philosophies around art and what/who influenced them. It's helping me understand my own spiritual approach to art. In school I was surprised by how much I enjoyed doing landscapes and it fits in with how I want to express the connection between mankind, nature and spirit. It's helpful for me to see how these two artists expressed their vision as it makes me feel more comfortable expressing my own. I find it interesting to watch my own work shift and change as I relax more into listening to the painting. The books are "George Inness and the Visionary Landscape" by Bell, Adrienne Baxter and "Heat Waves in a Swamp: The Paintings of Charles Burchfield" by Burlingham, Cynthia.
